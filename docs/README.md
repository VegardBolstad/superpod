- **Sonner** for toast notifications

## 🎯 Key Features

- **AI-Powered Search** with knowledge graph visualization
- **Drag & Drop Playlist Management** with segment reordering
- **Responsive Design** with collapsible panels
- **Audio Player Controls** with playlist navigation
- **AI Narration Settings** for voice customization
- **SuperPod Creation & Management** with metadata
- **Segment Preview** with transcript viewing
- **Real-time State Management** across components

## 📱 Responsive Design

The application is fully responsive with:
- **Desktop First** approach (1024px+)
- **Tablet Support** (768px - 1024px) with collapsible sidebar
- **Mobile Ready** (< 768px) with both sidebar and search collapsed by default
- **User Preference Memory** for panel states
